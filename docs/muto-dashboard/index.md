## Background: 

Muto Dashboard is an example web based user interface for managing and monitoring `Eclipse Muto` concepts such as `EdgeDevices` (Cars) and the `Stacks` (ROS software) running on these devices. You can extend the Dashboard with [liveUI plugins](../LiveUI/) that enables the user to communicate with Muto driven vehicles and their `Digital Twins`. An example [`Muto Dashboard`](https://dashboard.composiv.ai) that works with [`Muto Sandbox`](https://sandbox.composiv.ai) is is made available to you at [https://dashboard.composiv.ai](https://dashboard.composiv.ai)
